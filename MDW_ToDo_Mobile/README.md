# ToDo App - Maison du Web By zied bousnina

This React Native project is created using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Before proceeding, make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions until the "Creating a new application" step.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Start **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Run the following command from the root of your React Native project:


# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start


###  Step 2: Start your Application

While Metro Bundler is running in its own terminal, open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

**For Android:**


# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android

## Running Your Application

If set up correctly, you should see your app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, assuming your emulator/simulator is correctly configured.

You can also run the app directly from Android Studio and Xcode.

## Step 3: Modifying Your App

After successfully running the app, open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. For Android, press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows/Linux or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes. For iOS, press <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. ðŸ¥³
